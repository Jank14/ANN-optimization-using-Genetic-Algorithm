# ANN-optimization-using-Genetic-Algorithm
This project aims at using GA for updating weights and other learning parameters to improve accuracy of classification using ANN.For this we would be using Fruits360 dataset.ANN would be trained on this dataset and the weights updation would take place using GA to classify the fruits.
